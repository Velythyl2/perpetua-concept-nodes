# perpetua-concept-nodes
For Perpetua 2.0

Reimplementation of some ConceptGraphs functionalities. Check out [our website](https://concept-graphs.github.io/) and [the original code](https://github.com/concept-graphs/concept-graphs).

Please note that this codebase does not support the edges presented in the paper.

# UV Install
Clone repository and submodules
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:kumaradityag/perpetua-concept-nodes
```

That's it. **If you do this, ignore the following install section.**


## Install SAM3
If SAM3 was not part of the package when you first installed it - you can get it by running the following commands

```bash
pip install sam3@git+https://github.com/kumaradityag/sam3.git
pip install einops decord pycocotools
```

Next, you will have to request access to the checkpoints on HuggingFace from [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3).
You will also have to authenticate your account in the terminal by running `hf auth login`. Follow the steps [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/quick-start#authentication) to generate a user access token.


## Paths 
Update `conf/paths/paths.yaml`.

```yaml
# @package _global_
cache_dir: ??? # Where to save model checkpoints and other assets
data_dir: ??? # Where to look for datasets by default
output_dir: ??? # Where to save outputs
```
Alternatively, you can create your own `conf/paths/my_paths.yaml` and append `paths=my_paths` to all commands.

## Model Checkpoints
Download the following to ```cache_dir```, as defined in your config.
 * [mobile_sam.pt](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.2.0/mobile_sam.pt)
 * [yolov8s-world.pt](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.2.0/yolov8s-world.pt)
 * [scannet200_classes.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concept-graphs/concept-graphs/66175d63f466d264edce9f1fb6987c5ba1dcac0e/conceptgraph/scannet200_classes.txt)

## Example Data
You can download the Replica dataset to `data_dir` using the 
[download script](https://github.com/cvg/nice-slam/blob/master/scripts/download_replica.sh) from Nice-SLAM.

# Usage
## Quickstart

Mapping configs are defined with [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/). 

We define specific experiments with the `algo` and `dataset` keys. To run the detector variant of Concept-Graphs on a low-resolution
version of the Replica dataset, try

```bash
uv run python main.py algo=CGDetector dataset=Replica_low sim_thresh=0.89
```
The map and other assets will be saved to `output_dir`. `main.py` will also create
a symlink to the latest output in `output_dir/latest_map`.

For the slower, SAM-only variant, try `algo=CG` with `sim_thresh=0.85`.

## Parameters

The following arguments can be added to the main command.

* `sim_thresh=0.9`: Similarity threshold between 0 and 1 to merge objects. A high threshold generally gives better object definition, but also a higher occurence of oversegmented or duplicated objects.
* `overlap_eps=0.025`: The radius used for computing the geometric similarity (point cloud overlap). Generally, using the same value as `voxel_size` is a good default.
* `voxel_size=0.025`: The voxel size used for downsampling the object point clouds.
* `denoising_eps=0.1`: The epsilon parameter of the DBSCAN denoising callback. Setting this to 3 or 4 times the `voxel_size` is a good default.
* `max_points_pcd=8000`: The maximum number of points used per object for computing the geometric similarity. A lower number will make the program faster, but the geometric similarity less accurate, especially for large objects.
* `final_min_segments=5`: The minimum number of times an object should be detected to be kept in the map. Helpful to get rid of "noisy" segments that only appear once or twice in the sequence.
* `caption=true`: Ask a VLM to caption the objects. By default, we use OpenAI models and you need an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for this to work.
* `tag=true`: Ask a VLM to tag the objects. By default, we use OpenAI models and you need an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for this to work.
* `device=cuda`: Torch device for the perception models and mapping algo.
* `debug=true`: Save additional visualizations of the segmentations.
* `save_map=true`: Save the map. See the [Output](#output) section.
* `seed=123`: Seed.

Additionally, you can also use all the dataset arguments detailed in the [rgbd_dataset README](https://github.com/sachaMorin/rgbd_dataset).

The above list only includes the most common arguments. If you understand [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/), there are a lot more options that you can configure from the CLI. Add `--cfg job` to the main command to visualize the full config.

## Map Query
This is the main script used to: (1) associate pickupables and receptacles to objects in the Concept-Graphs' map, and (2) produce a PerpetuaMap that is ready for user using the Map server API.

To create a PerpetuaMap, run the following command:

```bash
uv run python map_query.py dataset.scene=run_0 debug=true
```

where the `dataset.scene` determines the major tick (hour) used to create the map and `debug` is an optional flag that allows the user to assess the quality of the associations in a Viser GUI.

There are other available verifiers for the data association process:

```bash
uv run python map_query.py dataset.scene=run_0 algo=[VerifyObjectsGT | VerifyObjects]
```

`VerifyObjectsGT` uses priviliged information to compute the data association while `VerifyObjects` relies on CLIP similarities + an LLM verifier to determine the associations.

## Map server
To visualize and interact with the latest map with Viser (`output_dir/latest_map`), use
```bash
uv run python map_server.py server=[ObjectMapServer | PerpetuaMapServer]
```
or provide your own `$MAP_PATH`
```bash
uv run python map_server.py server=[ObjectMapServer | PerpetuaMapServer] map_path=$MAP_PATH
```

The Map server allows the user to interact with either the standard Concept-Graphs map or the PerpetuaMap. The main difference between the two is that the PerpetuaMap allows for _temporal map queries_, whereas the standard Concept-Graphs one include CLIP similarities, segmentation, among other features.

## Agentic Reasoning
To interact with an LLM agent that uses the PerpetuaMap, use

```bash
uv run python agent.py
```

This will launch a Viser server that allows the user to send text queries to the agent. Furthermore, the user can also use the control panel to play with the different tools the agent can use.

## Output
The output consists of the following files and directories:
* `config.yaml`: The full config of this map.
* `clip_features.npy`: The object CLIP features as an `(n_objects, n_dims)` array.
* `point_cloud.pcd`: The complete point cloud.
* `segments_anno.json`: The object annotations following the Scannet++ format. This includes the point indices in the main point cloud, the caption and the tag of every object. Look at [this method](https://github.com/sachaMorin/concept-nodes/blob/791677da1f3de3e007fff0b4bb8f1478d2fe0c61/visualizer.py#L172) for an example of how to load object point clouds.
* `segments`: The top RGB and mask crops for every object. By default, the code keeps the crops with the highest mask resolution.
* `object_viz`: Visualization of the RGB crops, the caption and the tag for every object.
* `debug`: If `debug=true`, additional visualizations of the segmentations.
